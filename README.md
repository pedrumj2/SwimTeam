# swimteam
A practice website I wrote for my swim team. The website was written from scratch using Html, css and javascript. 
One of my main focuses on this project was to design a page that:
1- Is responsive
2- Uses lots of javascript and css animations and effects while maintaining high performance.

Some of the animations and effects used on the page were:
1- Multiple parallax effects
2- Frost Glass effect
3- Slideshows

All of these toghether managed to maintain acceptable performance on the chrome browser. Alot of the effects were executed in increments
and timed so they would occur on the page repaint effect. This was achieved using the requestAnimationFrame function in javascript. The
image below is the performance of the webpage. While there were some cases with an fps > 16 but comparing with similar pages it performed quite well:
